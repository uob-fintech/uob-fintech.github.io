A warm farewell to Eva Christodoulaki, who is leaving us at the end of September. Since joining [AI4CI](https://ai4ci.ac.uk/) in October 2024, Eva has been researching AI-based models for forecasting bond market returns, using data provided by [Propellant Digital](https://propellant.digital/). Initial results ([available here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-error-detection-in-bond-market-reporting-data)) were presented at the recent UK AI Research Symposium ([UKAIRS](https://www.ukairs.ac.uk/)). We wish Eva best of luck for the future!
